                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <hr>
                <img class="w-50 img-fluid rounded float-left profile mr-4" src="assets/images/profiel.jpg" alt="profile picture">
                <p>I was born in Ukraine and came here in 1998, the year of Fifa, when Zenedine Zidan scored those decisive
                    goals against Brazil in the French World Cup. You can tell I loved soccer, or footbal. Then I came to
                    USA where I studied in Gardner Street School. Everyone there was Russian-speaking and it was easy to
                    get accustomed to English language.</p>
                <p>As a kid I yoyo'd. I would be able to loop de loop, and make a Darth Vader with my hands, even a starship,
                    it was sick.</p>
                <p>Then in middle school I heard punk for the first time and my journey into Lo-Fi started. I've also studied
                    psychology in university and learned a lot of knowledge, but I felt it was too logical and in essence
                    all psychology is about feeling, 'feeling is healing', no need for deep mind analysis or dream interpretation.
                    I got tired of the arts and sought out something more scientific and by then coding was creating a buzz
                    and I got started with the free code camp.
                </p>
                <p>I bought a PC and converted it to Linux and deleted Windows, there was no going back. I also installed it
                    on my cousins computer because he couldn't install Windows and was running into problems. I ended up
                    making a boot drive for him as it allowed him to save his documents and always have a fresh install system.
                </p>
                <p>I've studied SQL and Python but never towards any monetary gain, so I've decided to learn React and web development
                    in depth. Thank you for reading</p>
                <p>TLDR: Lets learn web development together!!!</p>
